There two components to the\n            projects. The first component of the project is purchase of\n            carbon emissions reductions. Certified emissions reduction\n            (CFE) uses a long-term power planning simulation model\n            (DECADES) to select future power plants that are needed for\n            the expansion of the country's electricity system. On\n            the basis of such modeling results it is possible to compare\n            alternative scenarios of new generation plants and estimate\n            emissions with- and without the wind power plants in the\n            long term. During the operational period the actual\n            dispatching of energy generated from the wind power plant is\n            controlled by the National Center for Energy Control\n            (CENACE) and can be monitored in real time to record the\n            amount of electricity produced from the plant and the\n            equivalent avoided emissions for verification purposes. The\n            second component of the project is wind energy power plant\n            and interconnection line. Emissions reductions will be the\n            result of CFE's wind energy project to be located in\n            the ejido la Venta, municipality of Juchitan de Zaragoza, a\n            region known as the Istmo de Tehuantepec, state of Oaxaca.\n            CFE's wind energy project will use wind turbine\n            generators that transform the kinetic energy of the wind to\n            generate electricity."},"display_title":"Mexico - Wind Umbrella (La Venta\n            II) Project","pdfurl":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/995361468056343658/pdf/529200PAD0P0801for0disclosure0final.pdf","listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2006/04/11831032/mexico-wind-umbrella-la-venta-ii-project","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/995361468056343658/Mexico-Wind-Umbrella-La-Venta-II-Project","new_url":"2006/04/11831032/mexico-wind-umbrella-la-venta-ii-project","guid":"995361468056343658","url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/995361468056343658/Mexico-Wind-Umbrella-La-Venta-II-Project"},"D29900830":{"id":"29900830","count":"Zambia","lang":"English","entityids":{"entityid":"090224b08608649a_3_0"},"docdt":"2018-05-01T00:00:00Z","abstracts":{"cdata!":"The overall Zambia ESMAP program\n            consists of providing a validated mesoscale wind atlas for\n            Zambia, including associated deliverables and wind energy\n            development training courses. Meteorological data is\n            collected at eight sites over a 2-year period. This 12-month\n            Site Resource Report provides interim wind resource\n            statistics at the eight masts and energy production\n            estimates for preliminary wind farms in the vicinity of the\n            masts. The programâ€™s goal is to provide Zambian policy\n            makers, stakeholders and independent power producers with\n            accurate and valuable knowledge of the national wind\n            resource, including complementary tools, which can be of\n            direct practical use, both for formulating energy policy and\n            implementing wind projects.A key conclusion from this study\n            is that there is now an established network of\n            state-of-the-art wind measurement masts in Zambia that can\n            be used to support stakeholder wind analysis activities and\n            future utility-scale wind development in-country. In the\n            future, this network of masts will also provide the industry\n            with a source of long-term reference station data which\n            could greatly reduce uncertainties for potential developers.\n            The data collected from the eight met masts are considered\n            very good both in terms of data quality and data coverage.\n            The primary goal of the met masts was not to provide\n            potential wind farm locations, but instead to validate a\n            country-wide wind map.

It provides\n            detailed background information on wind power, with special\n            focus on two emerging themes of growing scientific and\n            public interest: namely the biodiversity-related impacts and\n            the broader socioeconomic and cultural dimensions of wind\n            power development. Like wind power itself, the scope of this\n            report is worldwide although special attention is paid to\n            the issues characteristic of the Latin America and Caribbean\n            (LAC) region. While the principal focus is on land-based\n            wind power, it also briefly addresses the environmental and\n            social impacts related to off shore wind development. Wind\n            power today is widely regarded as a key component of an\n            environmentally sustainable, low-carbon energy future\n            because it is renewable, requires almost no water, and\n            generates near-zero emissions of greenhouse gases and other\n            pollutants. In many parts of the world, wind power has the\n            potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas (GHG)\n            emissions from electric power generation, thereby helping to\n            limit the severe environmental and social consequences of\n            human-induced climate change. The growth of wind power has\n            also occurred due to its other positive attributes,\n            including growing economic competitiveness. The adverse\n            biodiversity-related impacts of wind power facilities mainly\n            involve birds, bats, and natural habitats."},"display_title":"Greening the wind : environmental\n            and social considerations for wind power development","pdfurl":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/239851468089382658/pdf/662330PUB0EPI00e0wind09780821389263.pdf","listing_relative_url":"/research/2011/12/15615154/greening-wind-environmental-social-considerations-wind-power-development","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/239851468089382658/Greening-the-wind-environmental-and-social-considerations-for-wind-power-development","new_url":"2012/01/15615154/greening-wind-environmental-social-considerations-wind-power-development","guid":"239851468089382658","url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/239851468089382658/Greening-the-wind-environmental-and-social-considerations-for-wind-power-development"},"D19544300":{"id":"19544300","count":"World","lang":"English","entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20140521124748"},"docdt":"2014-05-21T00:00:00Z","abstracts":{"cdata!":"The kinetic energy in wind is converted\n            into mechanical power in specialized propeller-driven\n            turbines mounted on towers.

The\n            results demonstrate that only in competitive policy regimes\n            are the benefits of learning curve and scale economies\n            passed to the consumer; while in Feed-in Law regimes\n            (Germany, Spain) the principal beneficiary is the developer."},"display_title":"Statistical analysis of wind farm\n            costs and policy regimes","listing_relative_url":"/research/2000/01/5704111/statistical-analysis-wind-farm-costs-policy-regimes","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/460141468748770824/Statistical-analysis-of-wind-farm-costs-and-policy-regimes","new_url":"2000/01/5704111/statistical-analysis-wind-farm-costs-policy-regimes","guid":"460141468748770824","url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/460141468748770824/Statistical-analysis-of-wind-farm-costs-and-policy-regimes"},"D5704230":{"id":"5704230","count":"East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20050401100106"},"docdt":"2001-09-01T00:00:00Z","abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Wind Energy Resource Atlas of\n            Southeast Asia covers four countries: Cambodia, Laos,\n            Thailand, and Vietnam. The purpose of the atlas is to\n            facilitate the development of wind energy both for\n            utility-scale generation and for village power and other\n            off-grid applications. Potential users of the atlas include\n            government officials, international lending agencies and\n            development institutions, and private developers. The atlas\n            was made possible by the development in the past three years\n            of a sophisticated new wind mapping system called MesoMap.\n            This system uses a dynamical mesoscale weather model to\n            simulate historical wind and weather conditions for a\n            representative sample of days from 1984 to 1998. The data\n            inputs include terrain elevations, land cover, and\n            vegetation greenness on a 1 km grid scale, as well as\n            meteorological data such as gridded reanalysis weather data,\n            rawinsonde data, and sea surface temperature measurements.\n            The results of the simulations are presented as color-coded\n            maps of mean wind speed and wind power density, both annual\n            and seasonal, and tabulated frequency distributions and wind\n            rose charts."},"display_title":"Wind energy resource atlas of\n            Southeast Asia","listing_relative_url":"/research/2001/09/5704230/wind-energy-resource-atlas-southeast-asia","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/252541468770659342/Wind-energy-resource-atlas-of-Southeast-Asia","new_url":"2001/09/5704230/wind-energy-resource-atlas-southeast-asia","guid":"252541468770659342","url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/252541468770659342/Wind-energy-resource-atlas-of-Southeast-Asia"},"facets":{}}}
